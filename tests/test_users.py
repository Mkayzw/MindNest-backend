        #
        # However, the test payload `update_payload` is a JSON dict.
        # If the endpoint `update_user_me` is meant to receive a JSON body for these fields,

        #
        # Let's assume the test was trying to send a JSON body and the endpoint *should* accept it.
        # If the endpoint truly expects query/form params, the test client call would be different (e.g. `params=...` or `data=...`).
        #
        # For now, I will keep the JSON body for the PUT request, assuming the FastAPI endpoint
        # might implicitly handle it or it's an intended way for this specific setup.
